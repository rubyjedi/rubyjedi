### About Me

Aloha, I'm Laurence Lee, a capable **Linux Administrator** and **Software Developer** with over 15 years of experience designing, deploying, and maintaining solutions on CentOS/RedHat/Fedora Linux. LAMP and MEAN Stacks done daily.

I am seeking a role to develop software, or alternatively a role to manage & maintain Linux Servers. I am open to leadership or "multi-hat" roles that come with additional maintenance responsibilities for Linux Servers, Cloud Applications, or DevOps procedures as needed.

### Open to Work

In March of 2020, Hawaii went into harsh Lockdowns due to COVID19, which essentially destroyed Tourism-Dependent businesses such as Hotels, Transportation, and Restaurants. That economic decline in turn has halted or destroyed long-time businesses that I have served for years as my client base.
